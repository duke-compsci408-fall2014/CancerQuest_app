Our application MyQ provides a platform for the aggregation of cancer-related questions, allowing patients to find questions to ask their physicians after diagnosis. Questions will be crowd-sourced from patients with the option for users to tag and rate them; this will create a ranking of questions so that patients can choose the ones that are considered most helpful. The application's primary function is to provide a database of questions; it is not meant to be an answer forum. After an initial diagnosis, patients are often in shock and unable to formulate the questions that they might later need to know - our application remedies this problem, not only by allowing patients to prepare questions beforehand but also generally making consultations more efficient. Auxiliary features, such as recording ability, will help patients remember the answers and advice given by their physicians during consultation.
